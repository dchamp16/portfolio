            My name is Peter Justine Ramos; I go by Justin. I love cycling. I graduated
            and got my AS in Computer Science info system at Salt Lake Community College.
            Now, I am looking for my first full-time, part-time, or intern job. I'm
            continuing my school at UVU, and I love every second of it, even though this
            is a tough semester. My current goal is to find a good job that will help me
            improve and continue my BS degree in Computer Science here at UVU. I am 100%
            confident that I will improve and conquer all the obstacles that hinder me and
            succeed in my ultimate goal. My goals are to have a family, live comfortably,
            and share all the skills I will learn with my kids. The world is changing
            rapidly, and I don't have enough professional experience to know about such
            things. However, I know that I'll do everything I take as a challenge and
            approach every project I face at work and in life. I am always open to
            challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and love learning new
            things. If I am given a chance to get hired by your company, I will assure you
            that you will not regret it and do everything to help your company. I would
            love to join a team, learn, be mentored by someone, and dedicate all my skills
            and talents to developing high-quality and unique products.
