        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Peter Justine Ramos; I go by Justin. I love cycling. I graduated and
          got my AS in Computer Science info system at Salt Lake Community College. Now, I
          am looking for my first full-time, part-time, or intern job. I'm continuing my
          school at UVU, and I love every second of it, even though this is a tough
          semester. My current goal is to find a good job that will help me improve and
          continue my BS degree in Computer Science here at UVU. I am 100% confident that
          I will improve and conquer all the obstacles that hinder me and succeed in my
          ultimate goal. My goals are to have a family, live comfortably, and share all
          the skills I will learn with my kids. The world is changing rapidly, and I don't
          have enough professional experience to know about such things. However, I know
          that I'll do everything I take as a challenge and approach every project I face
          at work and in life. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I
          am open-minded and love learning new things. If I am given a chance to get hired
          by your company, I will assure you that you will not regret it and do everything
          to help your company. I would love to join a team, learn, be mentored by
          someone, and dedicate all my skills and talents to developing high-quality and
          unique products.
